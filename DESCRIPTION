Description: Functions for the retrieval, manipulation, and visualization of 
    'geospatial' data, with an aim towards producing '3D' landscape 
    visualizations in the 'Unity' '3D' rendering engine. Functions are also 
    provided for retrieving elevation data and base map tiles from the 'USGS' 
    National Map ('<https://apps.nationalmap.gov/services/>').
