## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version, I fixed a note which was added to R-devel between my prior submission to CRAN and the package being reviewed, and have ensured tests are passing on CRAN machines.

This release points the default contours download at a new URL, and
removes raster and rgdal as dependencies.
