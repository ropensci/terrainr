## Overview

terrainr makes it easy to retrieve elevation and base map image tiles
for areas of interest within the United States from the [National Map
family of APIs](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/services), and then process
that data into larger, joined images or crop it into tiles that can be
imported into the Unity 3D rendering engine.

There are three main utilities provided by terrainr. First, users are
able to download data from the National Map via the `get_tiles`
function, downloading data tiles for the area represented by an `sf` or
`Raster` object:

``` r
library(terrainr)
library(sf)

# Optional way to display a progress bar while your tiles download:
library(progressr)
handlers("progress")
handlers(global = TRUE)

location_of_interest <- tmaptools::geocode_OSM("Hyampom California")$coords

location_of_interest <- data.frame(
  x = location_of_interest[["x"]],
  y = location_of_interest[["y"]]
)

location_of_interest <- st_as_sf(
  location_of_interest, 
  coords = c("x", "y"), 
  crs = 4326
)

location_of_interest <- set_bbox_side_length(location_of_interest, 8000)

output_tiles <- get_tiles(location_of_interest,
                          services = c("elevation", "ortho"),
                          resolution = 30 # pixel side length in meters
                          )
```

Once downloaded, these images are in standard GeoTIFF or PNG formats and
can be used as expected with other utilities:

``` r
raster::plot(raster::raster(output_tiles[["elevation"]][[1]]))
```

<img src="man/figures/elevation.jpg" width="100%" />

``` r
raster::plotRGB(raster::brick(output_tiles[["ortho"]][[1]]), scale = 1)
```

<img src="man/figures/naip.jpg" width="100%" />

Finally, terrainr helps you visualize this data, both natively in R via
the new `geom_spatial_rgb` geom:

``` r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() + 
  geom_spatial_rgb(data = output_tiles[["ortho"]],
                   aes(x = x, y = y, r = red, g = green, b = blue)) + 
  coord_sf(crs = 4326) + 
  theme_void()
```

<img src="man/figures/ggplot.jpg" width="100%" />

As well as with the Unity 3D rendering engine, allowing you to fly or
walk through your downloaded data sets in 3D and VR:

``` r
with_progress( # When not specifying resolution, default is 1m pixels
  output_tiles <- get_tiles(simulated_data,
                            services = c("elevation", "ortho"))
)

merged_dem <- merge_rasters(output_tiles[["elevation"]], 
                            tempfile(fileext = ".tif"))
merged_ortho <- merge_rasters(output_tiles[["ortho"]], 
                              tempfile(fileext = ".tif"))

make_manifest(output_tiles$elevation,
              output_tiles$ortho)

# We can then import these tiles to Unity to create:
```

<img src="man/figures/unity.jpg" width="100%" />

The more time intensive processing steps can all be monitored via the
[progressr](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/progressr) package, so
you’ll be more confident that your computer is still churning along and
not just stalled out. For more information, check out [the introductory
vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/terrainr//articles/overview.html)
and [the guide to importing your data into
Unity\!](https://docs.ropensci.org/terrainr//articles/unity_instructions.html)
